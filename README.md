# Concept Simplifier with ChatGPT

This is a beginner-friendly **Prompt Engineering project** that uses ChatGPT to simplify complex concepts at multiple levels of understanding: 
-  10-year-old child  
-  High school student  
-  College student  
-  Working professional  


##  Goal

To create a flexible prompt that allows users to take any topic — from "Bayes’ Theorem" to "Entropy" — and explain it in a way that builds intuitive understanding from simple to expert.

##  Prompt Template

## Example Outputs

### Concept: Entropy

> See: [`prompts/example_entropy.txt`](prompts/example_entropy.txt)

### Concept: Gradient Descent

> See: [`prompts/example_gradient_descent.txt`](prompts/example_gradient_descent.txt)

## How to Use

1. Open ChatGPT.
2. Paste the [Prompt Template](prompts/concept_prompt_template.txt).
3. Replace `{{CONCEPT}}` with any concept you'd like to understand.
4. Optionally, tweak the prompt to focus on one explanation level.

## Example Use Cases

- Learning difficult topics like quantum mechanics, AI, or economics
- Teaching others (kids, students, or teams)
- Creating flashcards, videos, or learning guides

## Future Ideas

- Add a "Quiz Me" prompt after the explanation
- Add comparison between two related concepts
- Turn into a web app using Replit or Streamlit
